Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  You do risk spoiling a few
surprises for yourself, though.  Best to play the normal way and discover
everything as it was intended, I think.  The best surprises don't even appear
in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not Google, and I can only take
so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, ads, social media),
I built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and
all of the puzzles.

The puzzles probably took the longest; the easiest ones were around 45 minutes
each, but the harder ones took 2-3 hours, some even longer than that. A lot of
effort went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as
much as I enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @ericwastl on Twitter.

<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 2: I Was Told There Would Be No Math ---</h2><p>The elves are running low on wrapping paper, and so they need to submit an order for more.  They have a list of the dimensions (length <code>l</code>, width <code>w</code>, and height <code>h</code>) of each present, and only want to order exactly as much as they need.</p>
<p>Fortunately, every present is a box (a perfect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboid#Rectangular_cuboid">right rectangular prism</a>), which makes calculating the required wrapping paper for each gift a little easier: find the surface area of the box, which is <code>2*l*w + 2*w*h + 2*h*l</code>.  The elves also need a little extra paper for each present: the area of the smallest side.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A present with dimensions <code>2x3x4</code> requires <code>2*6 + 2*12 + 2*8 = 52</code> square feet of wrapping paper plus <code>6</code> square feet of slack, for a total of <code>58</code> square feet.</li>
<li>A present with dimensions <code>1x1x10</code> requires <code>2*1 + 2*10 + 2*10 = 42</code> square feet of wrapping paper plus <code>1</code> square foot of slack, for a total of <code>43</code> square feet.</li>
</ul>
<p>All numbers in the elves' list are in <span title="Yes, I realize most of these presents are luxury yachts.">feet</span>.  How many total <em>square feet of wrapping paper</em> should they order?</p>
